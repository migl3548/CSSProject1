    <p>
        Refunds and Exchanges
        <br>
        All sales are final. No refunds. Verify all information (title, date, time, seat selection, etc.) before purchasing tickets. Please Note: All ticket exchange requests must be made at least 24 hours before your scheduled performance. Requests made inside of 24 hours before or anytime after your scheduled performance will not be eligible for on-account credit, exchange, or refund.
        <br><br>
        Subscribers may exchange tickets free of charge — one of the many subscriber benefits! Single-ticket holders may exchange for an additional fee ($5 per ticket). You may exchange tickets online, in person, or by phone for another performance within the same season, or receive on-account credit*. There is an additional cost if seating upgrades apply, and all exchange requests are subject to availability. You may also donate your tickets back to the Colorado Symphony and receive a donation receipt.
        <br><br>
        *PLEASE NOTE: All on-account credit from the 2024/25 Season must be used during the 2024/25 Season, ending with season finale of Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto on May 30 – June 1, 2025. All unused on-account credit will be converted into a tax-deductible donation to the Colorado Symphony at the completion of the 2024/25 Season.
